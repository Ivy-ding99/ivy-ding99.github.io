					<h1>The History of the Game</h1>
					<p>
						The traditional game of Hanging Man, also known as Hangman, is believed to have originated in the Victorian era. It is a word-guessing game that has been popular for generations. The game was initially played with pen and paper, where one player thinks of a word and another player tries to guess the word by suggesting letters. Over time, the game has been adapted to various formats, including digital versions and mobile apps.
					</p>
					
					<h2>The Rules of Game Play and How to Play the Game</h2>
        <p>
            Hanging Man is typically played with two players. One player, known as the "host," selects a secret word, while the other player, known as the "guesser," attempts to guess the word one letter at a time. The host draws a series of blank spaces representing each letter in the secret word. The guesser then suggests letters they believe to be in the word.

            To increase your chances of winning at Hanging Man, try these tips and strategies:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start by guessing common letters such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants (R, S, T, L, N).</li>
            <li>Pay attention to the pattern of the word as it is revealed. This can help you make educated guesses about which letters may be present in the word.</li>
            <li>Think about the possible word categories or themes, such as animals, countries, or professions, to narrow down your guesses.</li>
            <li>Be cautious with your guesses. Remember, you have a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game is over.</li>
