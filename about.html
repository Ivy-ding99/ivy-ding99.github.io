							<h1>About </h1>

							<h2> Who am I</h2>
							<p>
								I am a student of CPP program. I come from Shanghai China. After being in Toronto for 6 months, I like this beautiful place. The intensive study life is fulfilled, I learn a lot in C language, C++, software Testing and Web design. Although sometimes the assignments are very challenging, it also make me learn fast. The project driven course design is helpful.

                           <h2>Why I Chose Hangman Game</h2>
						   <p>When I saw the assignment requirement. Hangman is the first game in my mind. I started to learn English in middle school. At beginning, we need to memorize lots of English words.  One day, my English teacher came to the class and told us he will play a game with the class. The game is Hangman. Although it has been almost 20 years, I still remember how happy we were. For a long time,
							 English is my favorite course. Now I am a mother of two kids. Just last month, my daughter told me she found Hangman game on our digital TV. Since then, we have played Hangman every week. It brings us lots of fun, and it also helps my kid build up her vocabulary.</p>
